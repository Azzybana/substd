# 🌺 SubStd: High-Performance Core Replacement Library 🌺

## ⚠️ **WARNING: This Library is UNSAFE BY DESIGN** ⚠️

Welcome to SubStd - an experimental, performance-focused alternative implementation of Rust's std/core modules. This library prioritizes raw speed over safety guarantees! 🏃‍♀️💨

## 💫 Overview

SubStd provides blazing-fast alternatives to common std/core functionality by:

-   Removing runtime checks and bounds validation
-   Using unsafe optimizations aggressively
-   Providing zero-cost abstractions
-   Minimizing memory operations

## 🎯 Goals

-   Maximum performance over safety
-   Drop-in replacement for std/core modules
-   Minimal runtime overhead
-   Platform-specific optimizations

## ✨ Key Features

-   Unchecked operations for Vec, String, etc
-   Lock-free concurrent structures
-   SIMD-accelerated algorithms
-   Zero-allocation APIs where possible
-   Platform-specific assembly optimizations
-   Smart enough to tell you what caused panic in production

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1

-   [ ] Core data structures
-   [ ] Basic collections
-   [ ] Memory management primitives

### Phase 2\*\*

-   [ ] Advanced collections
-   [ ] Async runtime
-   [ ] Platform-specific optimizations

## ⚡️ Performance

Performance is our #1 priority! Expect:

-   Significantly faster than std for common operations
-   Works on any platform with rustc
-   #![no_std] compliant!
-   It's only error contol is to panic in production

## 🚫 Limitations

-   Safety guarantees are minimal, it does as told
-   Not recommended for safety-critical systems
-   Requires careful usage and understanding
-   May cause undefined behavior if misused
-   By design, may panic in production

## 🌸 Contributing

This is a work in progress! Contributors welcome, but please note:

-   Safety is secondary to performance
-   Design requirements always require 'what caused a panic'
-   Breaking changes are expected
