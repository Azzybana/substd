*High-Performance Core Replacement Library*

Welcome to SubStd - an experimental, performance-focused alternative implementation of Rust's std/core modules. This library prioritizes raw speed over safety guarantees!

It does not meet typical Rust promises of safety, so is a little sub-standard.

## üí´ Overview

SubStd provides blazing-fast alternatives to common std/core functionality by:

-   Removing runtime checks and bounds validation
-   Using unsafe optimizations aggressively
-   Providing zero-cost abstractions
-   Minimizing memory operations
-   Work around additional checks with it's own calls to externs.
-   Performs a valid action or aborts the process

## üéØ Goals

-   Maximum performance over safety
-   Drop-in replacement for std/core modules
-   Minimal runtime overhead
-   Platform-specific optimizations

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   Unchecked operations for Vec, String, etc
-   Lock-free concurrent structures
-   SIMD-accelerated algorithms
-   Zero-allocation APIs where possible
-   Platform-specific assembly optimizations
-   Dumb enough to do what you tell it
-   Smart enough to tell you what caused panic in production

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Future Goals

-   Since I'm still scaffolding, placed the first 2 stream handlers
-   Using kernel32, a console handler on windows
-   Using a boolean reference, and a static table, print to an led in morse code
-   This isn't a mistake
-   Part of the beauty of a rudimentary, fast, simple design is dexterity

### Phase 1

-   Really, I'm still laying all the groundwork
-   Yes, I'm using AI to help with some of the scaffolding
-   No, I don't trust AI to get it right when you're working this unsafely
-   Everything it writes simply gives me keywords to narrow down docs and do it my way quickly

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

Performance is our #1 priority! Expect:

-   Significantly faster than std for common operations
-   Works on any platform with rustc
-   #![no_std] compliant!
-   It's only error contol is to panic in production

## üö´ Limitations

-   Safety guarantees are minimal, it does as told
-   Not recommended for safety-critical systems
-   Requires careful usage and understanding
-   May cause undefined behavior if misused
-   By design, may panic in production

## üå∏ Contributing

This is a work in progress! Contributors welcome, but please note:

-   Safety is secondary to performance
-   Design requirements always require 'what caused a panic'
-   Breaking changes are expected
